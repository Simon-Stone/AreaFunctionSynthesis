# AreaFunctionSynthesis

A tool to synthesize speech based on a one-dimensional model of the vocal tract area function.

This is a trimmed-down and slightly revised version of SecondVoicePc (developed at the [Chair of Speech Technology and Cognitive Systems, TU Dresden](https://github.com/TUD-STKS)) and uses some of [VocalTractLab](https://github.com/TUD-STKS/VocalTractLabBackend-dev)'s backend classes to convert the area function into speech.

The model is described in:

Birkholz, "Construction and Evaluation of a Parametric One-Dimensional Vocal Tract Model," in IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing, vol. 26, no. 8, pp. 1381-1392, Aug. 2018, doi: [10.1109/TASLP.2018.2825601](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8336944).
