# AreaFunctionSynthesis

A tool to synthesize speech based on a one-dimensional model of the vocal tract area function.

This is a trimmed-down and slightly revised version of SecondVoicePc (developed at the [Chair of Speech Technology and Cognitive Systems, TU Dresden](https://github.com/TUD-STKS)) and uses some of [VocalTractLab](https://github.com/TUD-STKS/VocalTractLabBackend-dev)'s backend classes to convert the area function into speech.
